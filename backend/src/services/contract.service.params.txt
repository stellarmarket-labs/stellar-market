# Transaction Parameters (Mental Draft)
- `create_job(env, client: Address, freelancer: Address, token: Address, milestones: Vec<(String, i128, u64)>, job_deadline: u64)`
- `fund_job(env, job_id: u64, client: Address)`
- `submit_milestone(env, job_id: u64, milestone_id: u32, freelancer: Address)`
- `approve_milestone(env, job_id: u64, milestone_id: u32, client: Address)`

I'll need to use `SorobanRpc` and `TransactionBuilder` from `stellar-sdk`.
Since I'm building for the frontend to sign, I'll return the XDR.
Wait, if the frontend signs with Freighter, I can build the transaction on the backend and send the XDR to the frontend.
The backend needs a "source account" to fetch the sequence number, but the frontend's address will be the ACTUAL source account for some operations (or at least the one signing).
Usually, for Soroban, the client's wallet is the source account.
So I'll need the client's public key from the frontend to build the transaction.

Let's start implementing `contract.service.ts`.
