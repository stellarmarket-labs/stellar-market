/**
 * Fraud / anomaly detection service (issue #900).
 *
 * Design goals, in priority order:
 *
 *  1. **Review, don't auto-block.** Nothing here suspends, blocks, or hides a
 *     user or job. The only side effect of a high score is that the subject is
 *     surfaced in an admin review queue (`RiskFlag`). Human confirmation is
 *     always the gate before any punitive action.
 *
 *  2. **Minimise false positives.** Signals are normalised and combined with a
 *     noisy-OR model (see {@link combineSignals}) rather than a flat if/else
 *     rule list. That means a single genuinely strong indicator (e.g. two
 *     accounts wash-trading high-value jobs between each other) can raise the
 *     score on its own, while a legitimately busy account — high transaction
 *     volume but with none of the collusion / instant-release signals — stays
 *     well below the review threshold.
 *
 *  3. **Auditable, not transient.** Every scoring run is persisted as a
 *     `RiskAssessment` row with the exact signal breakdown that produced it, so
 *     a reviewer can see *why* something was flagged and how the score moved
 *     over time.
 *
 *  4. **Near-real-time, non-blocking.** Scoring is triggered inline from the
 *     job-creation and escrow-release paths via {@link onJobCreated} /
 *     {@link onEscrowReleased}, but those hooks are fire-and-forget: they never
 *     throw into, or add latency to, the caller's critical path.
 *
 * The thresholds and weights below are the tunable knobs. They live in code
 * (not the database) and are deliberately grouped so they can be calibrated
 * against real false-positive feedback (see {@link getFalsePositiveStats}).
