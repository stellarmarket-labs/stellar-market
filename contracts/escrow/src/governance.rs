//! Reputation-weighted on-chain governance for protocol parameters (issue #899).
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! This module adds a stakeholder-weighted voting path for changing protocol
//! *parameters*, running **in parallel** to — not replacing — the existing
//! fixed multisig. Broad reputation holders can now decide fee and treasury
//! changes, instead of those being controlled solely by the closed signer set.
//!
//! ## Separation of powers (explicit, enforced)
//!
//! Admin actions are partitioned into two **disjoint** domains, and the split is
//! enforced in both directions so neither path can bypass the other:
//!
//! - **Governable (governance-only) actions** — protocol parameters:
//!   [`AdminAction::SetFeeBps`], [`AdminAction::SetTreasury`]. Once governance is
//!   configured, these can *only* be enacted through the governance vote. The
//!   multisig path rejects them with [`EscrowError::GovernanceRequired`].
//! - **Operational (multisig-only) actions** — everything else: `Pause`,
//!   `Unpause`, `AddSigner`, `RemoveSigner`, `ChangeThreshold`, `RotateSigner`,
//!   `EmergencyWithdraw`. These remain multisig-only and cannot be proposed
//!   through governance (rejected with [`GovError::NotGovernable`]).
//!
//! Rationale: emergency/safety controls (pause, emergency withdraw) and the
//! composition of the signer set must stay fast and in the multisig's hands;
//! economic parameters (fee, treasury) are exactly what the broader stakeholder
//! base should control. Governance is "enabled" once [`configure_governance`]
//! has run; before that the multisig retains full authority (backward
//! compatible), and there is deliberately **no** disable function so a signer
//! majority cannot switch governance off to reclaim parameter control.
//!
//! ## Snapshot safety (anti-gaming)
//!
//! Each proposal records `snapshot_ts` at open time. A vote's weight is read
//! from the reputation contract via `get_gov_weight(user) -> (score, last_change_ts)`
//! and accepted **only if `last_change_ts <= snapshot_ts`**. Any account that
//! acquires or changes reputation *after* the proposal opens has
//! `last_change_ts > snapshot_ts` and is rejected with
//! [`GovError::WeightChangedAfterSnapshot`]. This defeats the classic attack of
//! pumping reputation to swing an in-flight vote. Reputation decay only ever
//! *reduces* the reported score, so the guard can never be tricked into counting
//! inflated weight.
//!
//! ## Delegation
//!
//! An account may [`delegate`] its weight to another address. Delegation is
//! **single-hop** and exercised explicitly: the delegate first casts its own
//! vote, then the delegator's weight is pulled onto the *same* side via
//! [`cast_delegated_vote`]. Each account's weight is recorded in a per-proposal
//! [`VoteReceipt`] and can be cast **at most once**, so re-delegating mid-vote
//! never retroactively moves weight that has already been counted. The
//! delegator's own snapshot weight (subject to the same anti-gaming guard) is
//! what counts — not the delegate's.
